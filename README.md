# vem-indicator-3D-dataset
Datasets used for "A quality indicator for polyhedral meshes in the Virtual Element Method" by T. Sorgente, S. Biasotti, G. Manzini and M. Spagnuolo.
These datasets have been created within the mesh generation framework presented in the Section 4 of the paper.

## Content
Each .zip file contains a dataset made of five meshes with decreasing mesh size; some of them are divided in two parts due to the file size limitations of github.

Each mesh is saved in the REGN_FACE format, which consists in a .node file, containing informations on the vertices:

_vertex id____x-coord____y-coord____z-coord_

and a .ele file, containing informations about the elements with the following structure:

_element id____n. of faces_

_______face id____n. of face verts____face verts ids_//
_______face id____n. of face verts____face verts ids_//
_______face id____n. of face verts____face verts ids_//
